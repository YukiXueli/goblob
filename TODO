In progress:
- swap players
- GoogleIdentity should be injected and in our GoogleIdentityProvider we should probably cache the avatar (getGoBlobActivity().getAvatarManager().setAvatarUri(playerName, currentPlayer.getIconImageUri());)
- Use the GoogleIdentity in the Player One Default Name Provider
- in onActivityResult, call displayGameConfiguration with a configured Remote GameConfiguration

Next things to do:
- handicap in remote games
- rename LocalGameRepository into GameRepository, which will handle a cache of remote games, and contain all the code related to them.

Medium priority:
- toast/buzz when another game is updated
- rotation displays wrong intermediate screens
- Improve winning message (name of player)
- improve debug level log management

Longer term:
- Move to a NavigationDrawer or keep spinner in toolbar
- continue a game in remote mode

Crazy projects:
- cardboard
- TV (chromecast, TV)
- Wear
- IA
