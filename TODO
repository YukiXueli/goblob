High priority:
- Support for local games: add the local game in the combo

Medium (probably before release)
- improve move picking accuracy (pinch)
- toast when another game is updated
- Improve winning message (name of player)
- kill StoneColor
- back button
- improve debug level log management
- restore rotation

Longer term:
- Be smarter when marking stones
- Move to a NavigationDrawer or keep spinner in toolbar
- Kill BaseGameActivity
- continue a game in remote mode
