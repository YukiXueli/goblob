In progress:
- It vibrates on onStart, which is weird because we only send an event when the game changed.
- Test moves on a remote game while offline
- generate random local identity instead of relying on google
- In GameRepository: multiple local games

Next:
- Popup local/remote
- GridLayout
- Thanks to GameRepository: espresso tests

Medium priority:
- toast/buzz when another game is updated
- rotation displays wrong intermediate screens
- Improve winning message (name of player)
- improve debug level log management

Longer term:
- Move to a NavigationDrawer or keep spinner in toolbar
- continue a game in remote mode

Crazy projects:
- cardboard
- TV (chromecast, TV)
- Wear
- IA
