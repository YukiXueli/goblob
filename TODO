Things to do:
- Calculate score

Bonus:
- Support for local games
- Be smarter when marking stones

Bug:
- In debug, when creating a new game, updateMatchSpinner is called 3 times, reselecting
    "new game" each time, and onNavigationItemSelected is called twice.
- But when running normally, the onNaviagtionItemSelected is called earlier, and a NPE happens
    a bit later.

- Or, for the lazy: just move it to a NavigationDrawer:
  1. As is.
  2. By moving the NewGame out.
  3. By using ExpandableListView.

New! Extra! Read this!
We want to fix the way we update the spinner. Instead of clearing it, we should update the items
(add item, remove item, or modify turn status), which will put an end to spurious selection events,
and only change the selection when the item disappeared, which is indeed a case where we don't want
to keep the old selection.
