High priority:
- On signout, update combo and fragment
- Support for local games: add the local game in the combo
- remove handicap
- Improve winning message (name of player)
- fix score (count stones)

Medium (probably before release)
- improve move picking accuracy
- toast when another game is updated

Longer term:
- Be smarter when marking stones
- Move to a NavigationDrawer or keep spinner in toolbar
- Kill BaseGameActivity
