On going:
- Create a ZoomableView, which GoboardView will extend.
- OnTouchEvent is inspired from ZoomLayout and calls zoom/scroll/click, the last one implemented
by GoboardView.

High priority:
- improve debug level log management

Medium priority:
- toast when another game is updated
- buzz when any game is updated
- Improve winning message (name of player)
- kill StoneColor
- back button
- restore rotation

Longer term:
- Move to a NavigationDrawer or keep spinner in toolbar
- Kill BaseGameActivity
- continue a game in remote mode
