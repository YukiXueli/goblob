Next things to do:
- Implement a googleIdentityProvider and inject it in MainActivity, and pass it go GoGameController constructor
- Fix all calls to player.getType into gameConfiguration.getType
- in the protobuf, rename PlayerType into GameType

- when the version of a game is too recent, link to play store
- move players in gameConfiguration
- handicap in remote games
- rename LocalGameRepository into GameRepository, which will handle a cache of remote games, and contain all the code related to them.

Medium priority:
- toast/buzz when another game is updated
- rotation displays wrong intermediate screens
- Improve winning message (name of player)
- improve debug level log management

Longer term:
- Move to a NavigationDrawer or keep spinner in toolbar
- continue a game in remote mode
