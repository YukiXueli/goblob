Urgent:
- rotation displays wrong intermediate screens
- do we have to unregister on disconnect/suspend
- signout/signin doesn't work anymore

Medium priority:
- toast when another game is updated
- buzz when any game is updated
- Improve winning message (name of player)
- improve debug level log management

Longer term:
- Move to a NavigationDrawer or keep spinner in toolbar
- continue a game in remote mode
