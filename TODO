In progress:
- Add a state to game data (initial conf, conf negociation, play, end negociation, finished)
- Add compat for state and turn
- To make game negociation work: manage the isAccepted
- In GameRepository,  handle a cache of remote games

Next things to do:
- inject GoogleApiClient to clean up the takeTurn* code.

Medium priority:
- toast/buzz when another game is updated
- rotation displays wrong intermediate screens
- Improve winning message (name of player)
- improve debug level log management

Longer term:
- Move to a NavigationDrawer or keep spinner in toolbar
- continue a game in remote mode

Crazy projects:
- cardboard
