In progress:
- move gameconfiguration creation code from MainActivity.configureGame to GameDatas, with handicap, komi and score_type
- make Player 1 (you) configuration part of the given GameConfiguration and use komi, handicap...
- in onActivityResult, call displayGameConfiguration with a configured Remote GameConfigfuration

Next things to do:
- handicap in remote games
- rename LocalGameRepository into GameRepository, which will handle a cache of remote games, and contain all the code related to them.

Medium priority:
- toast/buzz when another game is updated
- rotation displays wrong intermediate screens
- Improve winning message (name of player)
- improve debug level log management

Longer term:
- Move to a NavigationDrawer or keep spinner in toolbar
- continue a game in remote mode

Crazy projects:
- cardboard
- TV (chromecast, TV)
- Wear
- IA
