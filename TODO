Urgent:
- rotation displays wrong intermediate screens

Medium priority:
- rename LocalGameRepository into GameRepository, which will handle a cache of remote games, and contain all the code related to them.
- toast when another game is updated
- buzz when any game is updated
- Improve winning message (name of player)
- improve debug level log management

Longer term:
- Move to a NavigationDrawer or keep spinner in toolbar
- continue a game in remote mode
